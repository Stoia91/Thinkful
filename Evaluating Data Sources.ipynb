    "The question does not quite fit the one ask on the survey. The survey asks for a one-time overriding preference, while the question being posed is ask presumably what motivates each visit, so responses may not get the weight they deserve, based on the frequency of visits. e.g. regulars might come for the music, not the environment and thus music would account for a greater share of visits. A more appropriate question would be 'What is the most commonly preferred feature of a pub by Armenians'. The data is also unevenly distributed across time; the survey is only being conducted on the weekends! That means the quality of the data is compromised."
